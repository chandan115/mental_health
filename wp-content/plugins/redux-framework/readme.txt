<h4>🚀 TYPICAL USE CASE OF THIS PLUGIN</h4>
You are building a **big site** with **lots of pages** and you just want it to look amazing. With Redux, you can begin making pages with a variety of "starter blocks," or templates.

You can browse through the categories, as well as collections of like-styled pages. When you find something you like, Redux makes sure you have everything you need. If a dependency (or required plugin) is missing, you are notified and can install the missing dependency. Worried that our templates may not work with your theme? No problem! With our custom `page templates` options you can transform any site into exactly what you want it to be no matter what them you are using.

Don’t waste hours trying to recreate a design you love. With a click of a button, you have it on your own site, and you can begin customizing your "starter block" for your needs.

<h4>🔐 Privacy</h4>
Redux does not interact with end users on your website. Our templates will continue to work even if Redux is uninstalled. If a product is using Redux the option panel will cease to function without Redux.

Redux utilizes [AppSero](https://appsero.com/) for account management as well as to enable our premium offerings. You can find their privacy policy here: [https://appsero.com/privacy-policy/](https://appsero.com/privacy-policy/). Activation of Redux is not necessary, but additional features such as Google Font Updates and increased access to the template library will be limited.

The Redux plugin uses a custom API to fetch our content library and our Gutenberg templates. To improve the service and stability we store logs which may or may not contain the following:
<ul>
<li>browser type</li>
<li>referring site</li>
<li>date and time of request</li>
<li>template ID requested</li>
<li>date of cached version of the given API request</li>
<li>supported block plugins installed (slug only, no versions)</li>
<li>version of Redux installed</li>
<li>Redux API keys</li>
</ul>

API requests are only made when a user clicks on the Library button, launches the Redux Challenge, or opts into Google Font updates.
